# Grievance Management System Database Architecture

## Database Overview

This system uses a PostgreSQL database with multiple schemas to handle different aspects of the grievance management system. The main components are:

### 1. Authority Management
- Hierarchical structure of authorities (Top, Mid, and Operational levels)
- Different roles: District Magistrate, Commissioner, Department Heads, Block Officers, etc.
- Tracks authority relationships and jurisdictions
- Handles department assignments and responsibilities

### 2. Department Management
- Departments with hierarchical structure
- Department officers and workers
- Resource management and issue tracking
- Communication and announcement systems

### 3. Grievance Handling
- Citizen grievance submissions
- Multi-level categorization (category, subcategory)
- Impact assessment (economic, social, environmental)
- Status tracking and resolution workflow
- Location-based grievance management

### 4. Issue Management
- Aggregation of related grievances
- Timeline tracking
- Attachment handling
- Notification system
- Progress monitoring

## Data Flow

### 1. Grievance Submission Flow
1. Citizen submits grievance
   - Basic information (title, complaint, location)
   - Impact assessment
   - Category classification
2. System assigns:
   - Urgency level
   - Priority level
   - Department
   - Initial authority

### 2. Authority Hierarchy Flow
1. Top Level (District Magistrate, Commissioner)
   - Overall supervision
   - Policy decisions
   - Major issue resolution

2. Mid Level (Department Heads, Block Officers)
   - Department-specific handling
   - Resource allocation
   - Progress monitoring

3. Operational Level (Department Officers, Workers)
   - Direct grievance handling
   - Field work
   - Status updates

### 3. Resolution Flow
1. Initial Assessment
   - Department assignment
   - Priority setting
   - Resource allocation

2. Processing
   - Authority handling
   - Status updates
   - Timeline tracking
   - Communication management

3. Resolution
   - Solution implementation
   - Citizen feedback
   - Documentation
   - Closure

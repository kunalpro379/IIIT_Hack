# Grievance Analysis and Forecasting System

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing and forecasting grievance patterns using machine learning and statistical methods. It helps identify trends, predict future issues, and generate actionable insights from complaint data.

## Key Components

### 1. Trends Analysis (`trends_prediction.py`)
- Analyzes seasonal patterns in complaints
- Predicts emerging categories
- Forecasts complaint volumes using Prophet
- Identifies anomalies in complaint patterns
- Generates comprehensive trends reports

### 2. Root Cause Analysis (`root_cause_analysis.py`)
- Clusters similar complaints using DBSCAN
- Performs deep analysis of complaint categories
- Uses GPT-4 for insight generation
- Identifies systemic issues and patterns
- Generates detailed root cause reports

### 3. Grievance Forecasting (`grievance_forecaster.py`)
- Implements LSTM-based time series forecasting
- Analyzes category-wise patterns
- Provides detailed forecasting reports
